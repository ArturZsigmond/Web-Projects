# 🌱 My Web Experiments

Hey there!  
This folder is a growing collection of web projects and small assignments I've been working on as I learn the basics of web development.

So far, I’ve been exploring:

- 🧱 **HTML** for structure  
- 🎨 **CSS** for styling  
- ⚙️ **JavaScript** for interactivity  
- ⚡ **jQuery** for easier DOM manipulation

These are just small experiments — double-click interactions, editable combo boxes, sortable tables — that help me understand how things work behind the scenes in a browser.

## ✨ What I'm Learning

- How to build and structure web pages from scratch
- How to make elements respond to user actions
- How to update the DOM dynamically
- How to mix in small animations or UI feedback
- How to keep code clean and modular (still learning this part!)

## 🔭 What’s Next?

Soon, I’ll be diving into **Angular** and getting into more structured, component-based apps.  
I’m looking forward to learning:

- TypeScript basics
- Components, modules, and services
- Working with forms, routing, and APIs

This repo will probably grow with more advanced projects as I go — for now, it’s just my sandbox. 😊

Thanks for stopping by!
